Designing software is hard

preemptive counter critique, That once code commentary passes from the realm of
the technical into stylistic territory it becomes equivalent to artistic
criticism.

Section about working without a net, with no second party to provide discretion
or influence design decisions.

In concept art, digital painting (and digital sculpting), the initial process
often involves just applying big blobs of color. The goal is first to dirty the
canvas, to break down creative mental blocks, and once you have some interesting
shapes and forms you start refining what is working.

I sometimes follow the same process when coding. It is better to have a working
prototype of a bad idea than to endlessly research and tinker with a design that
doesn't get built. Once you have the thing in front of you it is much easier to
see where it is misshapen or lacking. You may also stumble into some spontaneous
_happy accident_, which is a primary goal of this process in concept art.

There is also a saying in art: you must kill your darlings. Just because you
found something interesting, or just because you've invested time perusing an
idea, that shouldn't unduly influence your design decisions.

In art the key to making that less painful is to work big and loose. Don't get
caught up in the details until you are ready to commit. I think in code there
are several ways to avoid minutia:

Firstly - don't code! Compilers and interpreters are very picky, but scribbling
on paper or a whiteboard doesn't require type-checking or valid syntax. Getting
big structural ideas down first will guide what you do next, and having them in
an ephemeral media helps when you have to scrap your designs later.

Secondly - learn to type! You need to be familiar and facile with your tools if
you want to work fast and loose, and your keyboard is your primary tool. There
is an [old Steve Yegge blog post](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html)
that sums it up well (though in not too few words). Obligatory quote: "If you
*really* think refactoring tools are a substitute for typing, it's like you're
telling us that it's OK for you to saw your legs off because you have a car".

Secondly - continued, learn your editor! The ability to run your code editor of
choice using strictly the keyboard has all the same benefits as learning to type.
I switched from a fancy IDE to VIM several years ago, and I am writing this post
in Emacs Evil mode. I love keyboard first, and modal editing, but whatever tool
you use learn to use it well. Here is an old post by Vim's author on the
subject: [Seven habits of effective text editing](http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html).
