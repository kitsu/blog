After a long search I finally found my first dev position.
<!--more-->
<hr/><br/>
Well, it took over five months, but I finally got hired. I now work for a
smallish agency here in Washington state as a software developer. They have a
lot of older apps written in ASP.Net WebUI using a widget set from some place
called Telerik. They also have about the same number of apps written against
SharePoint 2013, and a handful of legacy apps built in a variety of ways.

Leading up to my hire I had taken a break from this blog. Not strictly because I
had "burnt out" on it or some such, but mainly because I was doing a lot of
online training and some courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and
none of it seemed worth writing about. I will endorse the Stanford University "
Algorithms: Design and Analysis" courses though. They were well done, and made
an interesting compliment to the MIT-OCW algorithms lectures.

I actually started work back in the middle of December. Amidst the whirlwind of
new hire setup and the normal holiday rush I didn't have time to think about
blogging. Since then I have been playing catchup learning all these strange
Microsoft technologies I have never touched before. I did manage to get a few
things done, but nothing terribly interesting. Mainly just hacking through the
jungle of legacy "enterprise" code left over from an earlier time.

The working environment is good, they seem to have a reasonably good agile
methodology. They are generally conservative about what tech they use, but their
motivation to improve their processes leaves an opening for new ideas. The work
isn't the most interesting I could imagine, but I am getting a lot of good
exposure/experience.

More recently though I've been playing with some interesting things, and writing
some potentially useful code, so I would like to get this blog back up and
running. Hopefully I can get things written-up before the details start to fade.
