Re-grouping and thinking about next steps.
<!--more-->
<hr/><br/>
I've spent so many Saturdays in the office that it felt really weird to take a
two day weekend. Not needing to get up and go to work on Monday was even
odder. It would have been nice to take a break except now I have even more
pressure to prove myself as a programmer.

Over those two days I actually did very little of use. We've had the hottest
weather so far this year over the last few days, peaking on Sunday at 95 degrees
Fahrenheit. My first priority was just to clean up enough to make room for
everything I brought home from the office, and to setup a workspace. I cleaned
in two shifts both days, and only finished up Monday afternoon.

During breaks on Saturday I hit *Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices*
(APPP) hard, finishing over nearly twenty chapters. On Sunday I took another
break from uncle Bob and started doing some [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
exercises in C#. I want to start some big project in C#, but I think it was good
to start with those exercises. It forced me to think about very simple
algorithmic problems without the distractions of application architecture.

I have been using dynamically typed programming languages almost exclusively for
as long as I've been programming. When I have used statically typed languages all
the type declarations just seemed like a pain. They didn't add anything I didn't
already have in for example Python, they just made me spell-out things that
could easily be inferred.

Over the last few years there has been a bit of a holy-war brewing over the
merits of dynamic vs. static. It seemed dynamic was winning out with the rise of
Python, Ruby, and Javascript. Recently Haskell has been balancing the scales,
but the Haskell community seems to enjoy intellectual obfuscation as much as
powerful abstractions. Having written a little C# now though I am starting to
see some merits to the way static languages work, especially with respect to
classes as types.

Don't get me wrong, I still find the additional ceremony required for even
simple things irritating. For instance many of the patterns demonstrated in APPP
are completely unnecessary in Python, mainly due to duck-typing and the lack of
private/public distinctions in the language. I also have yet to see the amazing
number of problems static+compiled supposedly catch.

Anyway, it's hot and I want to get back to programming.
