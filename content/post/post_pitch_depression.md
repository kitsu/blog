I make a bid to change the job I have into the job I want, with luke-warm result.
<!--more-->
<hr/><br/>
It seems, for whatever reason, the people I work with don't want me to leave.
Lucky for them my greatest success so far in my job search has been getting some
feedback on a few of my rejected my applications.

Knowing that I want to move to a software development role; some people in my
office have been making noises at higher levels. As a result I got a chance
today to pitch a member of the executive leadership team. One of the projects I
have in mind would solve workload and staffing problems we've been having, and
also capture valuable data that we are currently throwing away.

On Tuesday I prepared some graphics and application mockups, and worked on my
delivery. The meeting got pushed from Wednesday due to a last minute schedule
change, but I spent basically all day today selling my plan. As a result of
my efforts and seemingly convincing arguments I've received a resounding *meh*.

Now I knew going in that the person I was trying to sell this to didn't actually
have the power to make anything happen. He is very sharp though, and he has the
ear of the CEO and other executives that *can* make decisions. If I got him on my
side I might have a chance of making a new position for myself.

In the end he agreed that if I could do what I said, and if I could adapt it to
the variety of business models that exist in our company, he thought it would be
worthwhile. He did not seem very optimistic about my chances of getting
green-lit with a budget though, especially not any time soon.

It turns out though that the CFO is actually currently tasked with resolving the
very problems my system would address. He is on vacation right now, which gives
me a little time to build a prototype and refine my pitch.

The question is whether it is really worth my time. I'll be working unpaid
building something nobody asked for to try and sell it to someone who doesn't
want it, or me for that matter.

So yeah, I was feeling pretty low today when I left the office. The last three
months of hard work trying to get a job have been a complete failure, and my big
chance to fix the job I have ended in apathetic mediocrity.

Today was also my self imposed drop-dead date - the day where I either get some
kind of concession in my current job, or quit outright and re-focus on my job
search. I expected the outcome of todays meeting to push me one way or the
other but instead I'm just more disillusioned and indecisive.
